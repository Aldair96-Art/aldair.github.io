                     I have choosen this page because with every filter we chose our context change but in a good way for 
                     example you are able to see that the images attached shows the necessary filters also the website show 
                     the right colors it is exactly what people needs.

                  <p>Visual hierarchy capture the attention with colors and specific features to guide the people and
                      accomplish the customer satisfaction. Nintendo is an example of this principle, we can see the "trending 
                      games section" pointing the Game cover,console belongs the game and its price. It is a perfect example because
                      automatically capture my attetion and what I am looking to buy.

                  <p>White space and clean design is not just white spaces- it is the right use of hierarchy, color and images 
                     and we can see in the image attached a good distribution of those things, I want to invite you to visit 
                     this website either in website or mobile option, looks great and user-friendly. Moze Studio create websites
                     and understand very well this principle.
